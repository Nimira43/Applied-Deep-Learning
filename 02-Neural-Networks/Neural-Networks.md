# What are Neural Networks?

#### Neural networks are fascinating, and here’s why:

##### 1. Inspired by the Human Brain: 
They mimic the way our brains process information. Think of them as a network of neurons connected by synapses, working together to make decisions.

##### 2. Layers: 
Neural networks consist of layers—input layers, hidden layers, and output layers.

###### Input Layer: 
This is where the network receives data.

###### Hidden Layers: 
These layers process the data. There can be multiple hidden layers, each transforming the data in different ways.

###### Output Layer: 
This layer produces the final output.

##### 3. Learning Process: 
Neural networks learn from data by adjusting the connections (weights) between neurons. Through training, they minimize errors, just like how we learn from our mistakes.

##### 4. Versatility: 
They can be used for a variety of tasks, from recognising images to translating languages and even driving cars.

##### 5. Types: 
There are different types of neural networks, each suited for different tasks:

###### Fully Connected Neural Networks (Dense Networks): 
Great for general tasks.

###### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
Excellent for image processing.

###### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): 
Perfect for sequential data like text and time series.

#### Neural networks are powerful tools that have revolutionised fields like AI and machine learning. They’re like a digital brain, capable of amazing things.
