# What are Neural Networks?

#### Neural networks are fascinating, and here’s why:

##### 1. Inspired by the Human Brain: 
They mimic the way our brains process information. Think of them as a network of neurons connected by synapses, working together to make decisions.

##### 2. Layers: 
Neural networks consist of layers—input layers, hidden layers, and output layers.

###### Input Layer: 
This is where the network receives data.

###### Hidden Layers: 
These layers process the data. There can be multiple hidden layers, each transforming the data in different ways.

###### Output Layer: 
This layer produces the final output.

##### 3. Learning Process: 
Neural networks learn from data by adjusting the connections (weights) between neurons. Through training, they minimize errors, just like how we learn from our mistakes.

##### 4. Versatility: 
They can be used for a variety of tasks, from recognising images to translating languages and even driving cars.

##### 5. Types: 
There are different types of neural networks, each suited for different tasks:

###### Fully Connected Neural Networks (Dense Networks): 
Great for general tasks.

###### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
Excellent for image processing.

###### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): 
Perfect for sequential data like text and time series.

#### Neural networks are powerful tools that have revolutionised fields like AI and machine learning. They’re like a digital brain, capable of amazing things.

# Neural Networks broken down

##### 1. Inputs:

These are the raw data fed into the neural network. It could be images, text, numerical values, or any type of data you're working with. Each input has its features, which are the individual measurable properties or characteristics of the data.

##### 2. Numerical Encoding:

Since neural networks work with numbers, any input data must be converted into numerical format. This process is called encoding. For example, text data might be converted using techniques like one-hot encoding or word embeddings, while categorical data can be transformed using label encoding.

##### 3. Learning Representation:

This involves the layers of the neural network learning to represent the input data in a way that makes it easier to identify patterns and make predictions. As data passes through the layers, the network learns to recognise more complex features. For example, in an image recognition task, the early layers might detect edges and simple shapes, while deeper layers might recognise more complex structures like faces or objects.

##### 4. Representation Output:

After processing the data through several layers, the neural network produces a representation that is optimised for making a decision or prediction. This could be a feature vector, which is a set of numbers that compactly represents the data's essential features.

##### 5. Outputs:

The final layer of the network transforms the learned representation into a meaningful result. In a classification task, this could be the predicted class of the input data (e.g., cat or dog). In a regression task, it might be a continuous value (e.g., predicting house prices).

Essentially, the process transforms raw input data into useful outputs through a series of transformations and learning steps. Each stage helps the network build a more accurate and meaningful understanding of the data.
